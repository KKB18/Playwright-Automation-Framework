# Automation Framework: Cucumber - Playwright - TypeScript

## 📌 Overview
This automation framework is built using **Cucumber**, **Playwright**, and **TypeScript** to automate web applications efficiently. It supports **BDD (Behavior Driven Development)** with feature files and ensures robust browser automation with Playwright.

## 🚀 Features
- **Cucumber for BDD**: Uses Gherkin syntax for feature files.
- **Playwright for Web Automation**: Fast and reliable cross-browser testing.
- **TypeScript for Strong Typing**: Ensures maintainability and scalability.
- **Parallel Execution**: Supports running tests concurrently.
- **Headless & Headed Mode**: Run tests with or without a UI.
- **Built-in Reports**: Generate detailed test execution reports.
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Easily integrates with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.
