      # Note: The checkout step needs to run *outside* the container 
      # to clone the code before the container starts. 
      # However, for jobs using the 'container' property, 
      # the checkout action is often omitted or configured differently, 
      # as the entire job runs inside the container, and the repository is 
      # typically mapped or available. Assuming your Docker image 
      # already contains all necessary dependencies and the environment 
      # is set up to run tests directly, we'll keep the steps minimal.
      # If your image *doesn't* contain the code, you might need to adjust.
      
    # Since the Docker image is expected to have Node, Playwright, and dependencies installed,
    # the setup-node, npm ci, and playwright install steps are removed.
